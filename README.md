## 🧠 Machine Learning Implementation

### Recommendation Engine
The recommendation system uses a hybrid approach combining:

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Analyzes product features (category, brand, price, etc.)
   - Creates product vectors for similarity matching
   - Recommends items similar to user's past preferences

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Learns from user behavior patterns
   - Builds user preference profiles
   - Suggests products liked by similar users

3. **Real-Time Learning**
   - Updates recommendations based on immediate user actions
   - Adapts to changing user preferences
   - Provides contextual suggestions

### Search Ranking Algorithm
The search system implements:

1. **Text Relevance Scoring**
   - TF-IDF based relevance calculation
   - Multi-field search (title, description, tags)
   - Fuzzy matching for typo tolerance

2. **Personalization Layer**
   - User preference integration
   - Historical search behavior analysis
   - Category and brand preference weighting

3. **Popularity and Freshness Signals**
   - Product popularity metrics
   - Trending score calculation
   - Recency boost for new products

## 🔧 Setup and Installation
